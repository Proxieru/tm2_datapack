# tm2_datapack
(WIP)
This is a datapack that aims to recreate valve's Team Fortress Two in minecraft!


# Version
1.21.9+ (Due to manniquins)

# Uses
Just open the world you would like to load this datapack into
and put it into the datapacks folder.

You should see "[TF2] engine now loaded." in chat when loading the world or enabling it, which indicates that the datapack exists and was loaded

# Features
- Team selection GUIs (Spectator will be added eventully)
- Class selection GUIs
- Round manager
- Backstabbing
- Doors
- Payload
- Capture the flag
- HUD
- General Objects
- Cloaking

# Extra stuff
Due to the scope of TF2, this project is naturally a
big undertaking. So if you'd like to just pop in and
add a weapon that would be really appreciated!
