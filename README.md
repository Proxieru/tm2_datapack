# tm2_datapack
(THIS IS WIP)

I decided to recreate tf2 in minecraft and this datapack is my attempt at that.
I've tried this before but my other attempts were deleted on accident. Feel free
to commit that'd be cool lol.

# Version
1.21.9+ (Due to manniquins)

# Uses
This datapack is meant to be loaded onto a existing world which acts as a map.
it just pulls the strings behind the curtains and manages rounds and entities.

Eventully when this is more complete I will put this on modrinth

# Extra stuff
This should go without saying but not all mechanics are 1:1. Minecraft has it limits (mostly due to bug, thanks mojang)
For example weapons that normally use damage dealt as a metric now use damage taken because there is a bug that
causes bow damage to not be recorded (again, thanks mojang).

Also some mechanics couldn't be added no matter how much I tinkered so sorry if stuff is different
